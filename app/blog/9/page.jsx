        <p className="text-neutral-400">
          Every business needs an online presence, but not all websites are created equal. Whether you’re launching a new site or revamping an old one, you’ll need to decide between a custom web design and a pre-made template. This decision impacts not just the look of your site, but also its performance, functionality, and long-term scalability.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">What is a Template-Based Website?</h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-400">
          A website template is a pre-designed layout that allows businesses to quickly set up a site with minimal customization. Platforms like WordPress, Shopify, and Wix offer thousands of templates, making it easy to find one that suits your industry. Templates are budget-friendly and time-efficient, making them ideal for startups or businesses needing a simple online presence. However, they come with limitations in customization, branding, and functionality.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Benefits of Custom Web Design</h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-400">
          Custom web design involves creating a website from scratch, tailored specifically to your brand’s needs. Unlike templates, a custom design allows for full creative control, advanced functionality, and an optimized user experience. Your website can be built to align perfectly with your brand identity, improve SEO rankings, and support long-term growth.
        </p>
        <p className="text-neutral-400">
          One of the biggest advantages of custom websites is performance. Since they are built with optimized code and lightweight frameworks, they load faster and offer a smoother browsing experience. Additionally, custom websites are scalable, meaning they can grow with your business without needing frequent redesigns.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Which Option is Best for Your Business?</h2>
        <p className="text-neutral-400">
          The choice between a custom web design and a template depends on your business goals, budget, and technical requirements. If you need a basic online presence with minimal investment, a template may work. However, if you’re serious about branding, performance, and user experience, investing in a custom web design is the smarter long-term decision. Custom websites help establish credibility, increase customer trust, and improve conversions, making them the preferred choice for businesses aiming for long-term success.
