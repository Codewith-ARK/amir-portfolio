          With mobile usage surpassing desktop browsing, web designers prioritize mobile-first design principles.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Dark mode has gained popularity due to its sleek appearance and reduced eye strain, especially in low-light environments. Many modern websites offer dark mode options, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes based on their preferences. Customizable themes enhance personalization and improve user satisfaction.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Small yet impactful animations and interactive elements create a dynamic user experience. Micro-interactions, such as hover effects, loading animations, and interactive buttons, add an element of delight while guiding users through the website. These subtle design choices make websites feel more engaging and intuitive.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Website speed plays a crucial role in user retention and SEO. Modern web design emphasizes performance optimization techniques such as image compression, lazy loading, and efficient coding practices. Faster websites lead to lower bounce rates and improved user satisfaction, making speed optimization an essential aspect of web design.
